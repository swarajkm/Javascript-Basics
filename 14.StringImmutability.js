var myStr = "Jello World";

//this wont work because we cannot change the string directly
myStr[0] = "H";

//but this can be done since it means we are replacing the whole string
myStr = "Hello World";

/* So in simple words, we can replace the entire string, but we cannot modify single character in a string */
