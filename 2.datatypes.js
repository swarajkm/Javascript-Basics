/* total datatypes in js are:
undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number and object */

//one way to create variable
var myname = "swaraj";
myname = 8;

//second way
let ourName = "freecodecamp";

//third way
const pi = 3.14;

/* difference between all 3 is:

using var we can use that variable throughout our program

using let the variable can be used only within the defined scope

using const, we cannot change the value once it is assigned*/
